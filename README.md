# 🚀 Java DSA Journey — Keerthi

This repository documents my daily progress while learning **Data Structures & Algorithms using Java**.

The focus is on improving problem-solving skills, strengthening logical thinking, and maintaining consistency through daily practice.

## 📅 Progress Log

### ✅ Day 1 — Two Sum (LeetCode #1)
Topic: Arrays / Hashing  
Pattern: HashMap Lookup  
Time: O(n) | Space: O(n)  
Learning: Complement storage removes nested loop comparisons.

---

### ✅ Day 2 — Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock (LeetCode #121)
Topic: Arrays / Greedy  
Pattern: Prefix Minimum Tracking  
Time: O(n) | Space: O(1)  
Learning: Maintaining the minimum value so far eliminates the need for pair comparisons.
