# 🚀 Java DSA Journey — Keerthi

This repository documents my daily progress while learning **Data Structures & Algorithms using Java**.

The focus is on improving problem-solving skills, strengthening logical thinking, and maintaining consistency through daily practice.

## 📅 Progress Log

### ✅ Day 1 — Two Sum (LeetCode #1)
- **Topic:** Arrays / Hashing
- **Approach:** HashMap complement technique
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)

**Key Learning:**  
Using a HashMap to store complements helps reduce brute force O(n²) complexity to O(n).
