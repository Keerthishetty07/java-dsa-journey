# 🚀 Java DSA Journey — Keerthi

This repository documents my daily progress while learning **Data Structures & Algorithms using Java**.

The focus is on improving problem-solving skills, strengthening logical thinking, and maintaining consistency through daily practice.

## 📅 Progress Log

### ✅ Day 1 — Two Sum (LeetCode #1)
Topic: Arrays / Hashing  
Pattern: HashMap Lookup  
Time: O(n) | Space: O(n)  
Learning: Complement storage removes nested loop comparisons.

---

### ✅ Day 2 — Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock (LeetCode #121)
Topic: Arrays / Greedy  
Pattern: Prefix Minimum Tracking  
Time: O(n) | Space: O(1)  
Learning: Maintaining the minimum value so far eliminates the need for pair comparisons.

---

### ✅ Day 3 — Maximum Subarray (LeetCode #53)
Topic: Arrays / Dynamic Programming  
Pattern: Kadane’s Algorithm (State Compression)  
Time: O(n) | Space: O(1)  

Learning:  
Instead of checking all subarrays, maintaining a running sum and resetting it when it becomes harmful leads to an optimal linear-time solution.

---

✅ Day 4 — Merge Intervals (LeetCode #56)  
Topic: Arrays / Sorting  
Pattern: Interval Merging (Sort + Greedy)  
Time Complexity: O(n log n)  
Space Complexity: O(n)

Key Learning:
Sorting intervals by start time simplifies overlap detection. Instead of comparing every pair, tracking only the last merged interval allows a clean linear merge process.
Insight:
Preprocessing through sorting often transforms complex comparison problems into simple single-pass solutions.
